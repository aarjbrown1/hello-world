Hello everyone, My name is Aaron Brown and I am from Atlanta, GA. I am a fairly new dad to a beautiful 4 month old baby girl!  Was a Biology major in undergrad, and then Epidemiology MPH. Worked as a microbiologist for 5 years, but desired a career shift **coughs(work from home)**. I like to go out, fish, swim, jog, listen to music, watch anime, and play video games (mainly nintendo). I am looking forward to working with you all!
